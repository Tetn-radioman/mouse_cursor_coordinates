For what?
You will know the current coordinates of the mouse cursor.
How to use?
After starting the program there are 10 seconds before calibrating the coordinates!
After calibration, you cannot move the program window, because zero coordinates in the upper left corner and depend only on it!
Therefore, within 10 seconds after starting, move the window to a convenient place and place the mouse cursor in the upper left corner of the screen!
